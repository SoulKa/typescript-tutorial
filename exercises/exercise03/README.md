# Exercise 03 - Webserver

This exercise aims to be a realistic use-case of TypeScript. We will build a simple webserver that
runs and caches the ping tests under `/ping` from the last exercise. As a bonus task,
the `/products` API mirrors a remote API and returns the filtered data.

The API already exists, only the implementation is missing. You can find the Postman and Bruno
Collections in the exercise root.
